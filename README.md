# FinTech-Module-11-Challenge - Forecasting-Net-Prophet

## Application:
In this Challenge, you will analyze the company's financial and user data in clever ways to make the company grow. So, you want to find out if the ability to predict search traffic can translate into the ability to successfully trade the stock.

When you present the idea, your manager loves it! So, you’re asked to create a prototype for submitting your crypto portfolio proposal to the company board of directors.
